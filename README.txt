Use Chipolo in your smart home:

- View the battery and connection state of your Chipolos
- View the battery level of your phone
- Ring your phone

NOTE: The connection alarm in the Chipolo device is the phone's connection state to the Chipolo. Homey doesn't connect to your Chipolos directly, as this would break the mobile app functionality.
